1. Wall time
I see the wall time a lot, but really bothered look what is it exactly. It's actually really simple: It's the time from the task start time to task finish time, which is refering to the time on the wall clock. 

2. sm_86
I recently bought a RTX 3080 card and tried to get it working with some deep learning project. So I kind of need to install cuda. The question is which version. As 11.1 is the lastest at the moment, I naturally installed that one. However, on Pytorch website, it seemed like that it only supports to 11.0. Luckily, after installing and testing, they seems working together just fine. 

But it got me curious, if it would have worked with cuda 11.0. 
I'm still not quite sure but according to [this post][matching-arch], it seems 11.1 is the one to go.

So much to learn about GPU computation. Good to start from somewhere
